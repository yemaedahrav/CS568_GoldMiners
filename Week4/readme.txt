Week4
	1. Data_Processing_files_and_code
	It contains files like combine_matrix , combine_words , 2D_to_coordinate format conversion code files used to preprocess datasets for the algorithm
	
	2. Test_Datasets
	2.1 Datasets_2d
	contains MED_CISI,MED_CRAN ,MED_CISI_CRAN and the toy_Dataset for this week in mxn matrix format.
	
	2.2 Datasets_CC
	contains all previously stated datasets in coordinate format
	
	3.Intermediate_files_dense
	these were obtained by running the code which is using dense matrix and reading input from 2D format. These are the ones to be used for presentation as all the files have a simple 2D matrix which is easier to analyze. But our final code remains to be the sparse aka updated one.
	
	4.Intermediate_files_sparse
	Obtained by running current sparse version
	
	5.code_coordinate_format_input_and_all_matrices_to_sparse
	Updated code
	
	6.code_with_2D_input_and_dense_matrices
	old 2D code
	
Note: Kparitition.cpp is the latest updated,fastest running code for now. It is the one on which memory profiling has been done
